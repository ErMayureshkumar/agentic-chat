### ðŸ”¹ Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Multi-Agent Orchestration** | Efficient coordination across specialized agents (Math, Weather, Knowledge, etc.) using **A2A protocol**. |
| **Protocol-Driven Communication** | Structured messaging using **A2A, MCP, and AG_UI** ensures reliable and consistent task execution. |
| **Context-Aware Conversations** | Maintains multi-turn conversations using **LangGraph shared memory**, **Redis cache**, and **MongoDB** for persistent session state. |
| **Secure & Policy-Driven Operations** | Guardrails, **JWT authentication** and intent filtering ensure safe interactions. |
| **Plug-and-Play Agent Integration** | Easy addition of new agents, APIs, or tools via **MCP modules** without disrupting existing workflows. |
| **Multimodal Support (Planned)** | Text, voice, image, and video interactions for natural human-like communication. |
| **Error Handling & Fallbacks** | Structured mechanisms for task rerouting, retries, and conflict resolution between agents. |
| **Workflow Automation** | Parallel, sequential, and conditional multi-agent workflows with **MongoDB** persistence for audit and reproducibility. |
| **Extensible Backend (Planned)** | Supports multiple LLMs (**Ollama, HuggingFace, OpenAI**) and modular plugin architecture. |

### ðŸ”¹ Benefits

- **High Performance:** Redis caching ensures low-latency multi-agent interactions.  
- **Scalable Architecture:** Distributed-ready with separate persistent (**MongoDB**) and cache (**Redis**) layers.  
- **Safe & Reliable:** Guardrails and structured protocols reduce risk in sensitive domains (Finance, Health, Travel).  
- **Flexible & Extensible:** Supports rapid experimentation and domain-specific agent deployment.
