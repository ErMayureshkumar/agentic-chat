### ✨ Backend Features

**Agentic-Chat** is engineered with a strong focus on **security**, **modularity**, and **extensibility** — enabling seamless orchestration and collaboration between intelligent agents.

---

### 🔹 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration (A2A + MCP + AG_UI)
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)** → enables seamless communication and task delegation between agents.  
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** → ensures structured, standardized commands across agents.  
- **AG_UI (Agentic UI Protocol)** → powers the front-end communication layer between users and agents.  
- 🧠 *Benefit*: Enables multiple specialized agents (Math, Weather, Knowledge, etc.) to **collaborate on complex tasks** in real-time.

---

### 🔹 2. Guardrail System
- **Intent Filtering** → prevents out-of-scope or unsafe queries.  
- **Conversation Safety** → protects against malicious prompts, hallucinations, or misuse.  
- **Scope Limits** → enforces domain-specific boundaries (e.g., math-only, weather-only).  
- 🛡️ *Benefit*: Ensures **responsible AI use** with compliance-ready safeguards.

---

### 🔹 3. Modular Pipeline
- **Plug-in Tools** → connect APIs, external services, or custom logic effortlessly.  
- **Dynamic Agents** → add/remove agents without breaking the core system.  
- **Flexible Routing** → orchestrate tasks through custom workflows.  
- ⚙️ *Benefit*: Build your own **agent ecosystem** with drop-in modularity.

---

### 🔹 4. Extensible for LLMs
- Works seamlessly with **Ollama** (local models), **HuggingFace**, and **OpenAI APIs**.  
- Unified configuration for model settings: temperature, max tokens, stop sequences.  
- Multi-backend fallback to ensure resilience if one provider fails.  
- 🤖 *Benefit*: Future-proof design with **support for multiple LLM backends**.

---

### 🔹 5. UI Layer
- **FastAPI** → backend API services for communication and orchestration.  
- **Streamlit** → interactive dashboards for real-time agent interaction.  
- **Frontend integration** → customizable UI for enterprises.  
- 💻 *Benefit*: Provides both **developer APIs** and **end-user interfaces** out of the box.

---

✨ **In short:**  
**Agentic-Chat** combines **multi-agent intelligence, guardrails, modular pipelines, LLM extensibility, and intuitive UI** to create a **next-gen conversational AI system**.
