## üóÇÔ∏è Data & Memory Layer

Agentic-Chat relies on a robust **Data & Memory Layer** to maintain state, store user information, and enable fast access for multi-agent interactions.  
This layer ensures that conversations, agent states, and workflow results are persistently and efficiently managed.

### üîπ Components

| Component              | Purpose                                                                 | Technology Used        |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **User Data Storage**   | Stores user profiles, authentication details, and preferences           | MongoDB               |
| **Chat & Session Storage** | Maintains chat history, session states and conversation metadata for multi-turn dialogues | MongoDB |
| **Cache Layer**         | Provides fast, in-memory access to frequently accessed data, session tokens, and temporary workflow states | Redis |
| **Agent Memory State**  | Keeps track of LangGraph shared state for agents to maintain context across multi-agent workflows | Redis + MongoDB |
| **Workflow & Task Logs** | Stores task execution results, errors, and audit logs for reproducibility | MongoDB |

### üîπ Data Flow

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ User Authentication
- User logs in via **JWT**.  
- User profile and permissions are fetched from **MongoDB**.  
- Session token cached in **Redis** for fast validation.  

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Chat Session Management
- Conversations are stored in **MongoDB** with metadata (timestamps, agents involved, intents, MCP tasks).  
- **Redis** caches active session states to reduce latency in multi-agent interactions.  

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Agent Memory
- Agents share conversation context via **LangGraph**.  
- Temporary agent reasoning states are stored in **Redis**.  
- Long-term knowledge (e.g., previous workflows, user preferences) persists in **MongoDB**.  

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Caching & Optimization
- Frequently requested external API results (e.g., weather) are cached in **Redis**.  
- Enables **fast response times** and reduces redundant external calls.

### üîπ Benefits

- **Persistence & Reliability:** MongoDB ensures all critical chat and user data are safely stored.  
- **High Performance:** Redis provides **low-latency access** to session and agent state data.  
- **Scalability:** Separating persistent storage (MongoDB) from cache (Redis) allows distributed and high-traffic deployments.  
- **Context-Aware Multi-Agent Operations:** Combined with **LangGraph**, agents can maintain shared memory, ensuring smooth multi-turn, multi-agent conversations.
