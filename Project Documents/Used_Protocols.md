## 🧩 Protocols in Agentic-Chat

**Agentic-Chat** uses **three specialized protocols** for agent coordination and interaction:

---

### 1️⃣  Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol

**Agentic-Chat** implements the **A2A protocol** to enable secure, interoperable, and intelligent communication between agents. Each agent can discover, negotiate, and delegate tasks through standardized message passing and capability exchange.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
To enable **autonomous cooperation** between specialized agents — allowing them to share information, balance workloads, and recover from failures collaboratively.

---

## ⚙️ Key Highlights

- **🧩 Capability Discovery** — Agents publish *Agent Cards* describing their skills, APIs, and roles for intelligent routing.  
- **💬 Structured Messaging** — Uses **JSON-RPC–based schemas** over HTTP/SSE/WebSocket for seamless interoperability.  
- **🔗 Task Orchestration** — Supports delegation, progress updates, and chained reasoning across multiple agents.  
- **⚡ Real-Time & Multimodal** — Works asynchronously or in real time, exchanging text, audio, or visual data.  
- **🛡️ Secure & Extensible** — Built with authentication, sandboxing, and modular extensions for safe collaboration.  

---

## 🔹 Example Flow

| Agent | Query | Response |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 🧮 Math Agent | “What is 25 × 12?” | “The answer is 300.” |
| 🌦️ Weather Agent | “What’s the weather in Ahmedabad today?” | “33 °C, partly cloudy, chance of evening rain.” |
| 📚 Knowledge Agent | “Tell me about the India–Pakistan partition.” | “The 1947 partition divided British India into India and Pakistan, triggering mass migration.” |

**How it works:**  
Each agent independently handles its domain-specific query while A2A coordinates their sequence and merges results into a unified reply.

---

### 🧠 In short:
**A2A** is the collaboration engine of **Agentic-Chat** — it lets agents talk, share intelligence, and cooperate dynamically.

---


### 2️⃣ Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** in Agentic-Chat follows the official open standard defined at **[modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)**, ensuring interoperability, structured communication, and consistent task execution between agents and tools.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
MCP defines a **universal standard** for how agents, models, and tools exchange context and commands in a structured, reliable way. It acts as the *common language* ensuring all agents — Math, Weather, Knowledge, etc. — understand and execute tasks consistently.

In Agentic-Chat, **MCP bridges** the logic layer (agents) and the capability layer (tools, APIs, or local modules).

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **🔄 Standardized Communication** — Uses **JSON-RPC** for structured model–tool–agent messaging.  
- **🏗️ Client–Server–Host Architecture** — Decouples orchestration (*Host*), routing (*Client*), and capabilities (*Server*).  
- **🧭 Capability Discovery** — Auto-detects available tools, resources, and prompts via standard methods.  
- **📏 Schema Validation** — Ensures all commands follow defined JSON Schemas for consistency.  
- **🌐 Transport Flexibility** — Works over stdio, HTTP/SSE, or WebSocket.  
- **🧰 Tool & Resource Abstraction** — Unified interface to invoke actions or fetch contextual data.  
- **🧠 Context & Prompt Management** — Enables dynamic, reusable prompts and context injection.  
- **❗ Error Handling** — Provides standardized error codes and fallback mechanisms.  
- **🧩 Extensibility** — Easily add new agents/tools without breaking existing flows.  
- **🛡️ Security & Guardrails** — Supports intent filtering and safe execution policies.

---

## 🔹 Example Implementations

| Agent Type | MCP Example | Backend |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| 🧮 Math Agent | Math MCP | Local MCP Server (e.g., WolframAlpha) |
| 🌦️ Weather Agent | Weather MCP | Local MCP Server integrating OpenWeather / WeatherAPI / WeatherStack |
| 📚 Knowledge Agent | Knowledge MCP | Remote MCP Servers (Wikipedia, DuckDuckGo, etc.) |

---

### 🧠 In short:
**MCP** defines the **universal command language** — ensuring every agent “speaks” and “understands” tasks consistently.

---

### 3️⃣ AG_UI — Agentic User Interface Protocol

The **AG_UI Protocol** defines how humans and multi-agent systems interact through a unified, **event-driven interface**. It bridges natural language and structured, multi-agent orchestration, ensuring clarity, safety, and real-time interactivity.

---

## ⚙️ Key Highlights

- **⚡ Event-Driven Architecture** — Agents and UI exchange structured events  
  (*TEXT_MESSAGE*, *TOOL_CALL*, *STATE_UPDATE*) for live interaction.  
- **💬 Natural → Structured Translation** — Converts user intents into validated **MCP-compatible** commands for agents.  
- **🔁 Streaming & Real-Time Updates** — Uses WebSocket/SSE transport for incremental responses and UI synchronization.  
- **🧠 Context & Memory Management** — Maintains conversational state, tool outputs, and user session context.  
- **🛡️ Secure Intent Filtering** — Guards against unsafe prompts and ensures only authorized actions are executed.  
- **🎨 Unified UI Rendering** — Aggregates agent responses and UI events (buttons, forms, suggestions) into a cohesive conversational interface.

---

## 🔹 Example Flow

**User:** “What’s the weather in Navsari and solve 2 + 2?”  
**AG_UI flow:**  
1. Splits the request into two structured MCP tasks:  
   - Weather MCP → Weather Agent  
   - Math MCP → Math Agent  
2. Collects both results → merges and displays the unified answer to the user.

---

### 🧠 In short:
**AG_UI** is the **human–system bridge**, transforming natural dialogue into structured, event-driven multi-agent collaboration.
